## Vision

I am well aware of the importance of monitoring information, so my goal is to create the most comprehensive and intuitive monitoring tool that allows you to easily grasp the system's status. The development of Monitor Pro is driven by the aim to meet everyone's various system monitoring needs.

Furthermore, in the future, I also intend to integrate chart designs to make the data even more intuitive and easy to understand.
